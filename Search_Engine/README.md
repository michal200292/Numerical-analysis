# Search Engine

The goal of this project was to create a simple search engine. It required to collect a corpus of documents which then had to be turned \
into bag of words representation. The user was supposed to give a prompt, which was converted into bag of words and the compared to \
all the documents using cosine similarity. The documents with the highest metric score would pop up in the results. \

The documents I used are from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions. \
It's a collection of questions and answers from Stack Overflow with the Python tag. \
The questions are from the years 2008 to 2016. The dataset contained over 600,000 examples.

## Frontend

The project also included writing a simple frontend. I used [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
