# Linear Systems

## Gauss-Jordan
First task was to implement different methods of gauss-jordan method for solving linear systems \
and then compare them in terms of time efficiency and numerical stability.

## LU decomposition
Implementing and analyzing algorithm for computing LU decomposition

## Electrical Circuit Analyzer

The third task was to use Linear Systems for interpreting and solving electrical circuits. \
The circuit was represented by a weighted undirected graph. Edges weights represented \
resistence between nodes. The goal was to use Kirchhoff's laws (and/or) Nodal analysis \
to find the values and directions of the current flowing between nodes.
