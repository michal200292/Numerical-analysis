# Simulated Annealing

## Traveling Salesman Problem

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is about finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities exactly \
once and returns to the starting city. The optimal solution to this task cannot be found for efficiently.\
The goal of this task was write a solver for finding approximate solution using simulated annealing method.

## Binary images

In this exercise, I was tasked with generating random binary images with a specified density of black pixels. \
I then defined my own objective function and attempted to minimize it using simulated annealing to observe the \
emergence of some intriguing patterns.

## Sudoku

The last task was to solve the sudoku puzzle. The objective function in this case was the number of repeated \
numbers in every row, column and 3x3 square. The goal was to reduce the number of repetitions downed \
to zero because, as this would indicate that the puzzle is solved.
